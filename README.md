### Why build Micrograd? 

In 2020, Andrej Karpathy implemented a small, scalar valued Autograd engine inspired by PyTorch. To develop a better understanding of neural networks and backpropagation, I will follow in his footsteps!
We will implement backpropagation over dynamically built DAG. Let's gooo!
